==================

Pre-built containers with lunchbox and its dependencies already
installed are available on `Github Container Registry
<https://ghcr.io/DiamondLightSource/lunchbox>`_.

Starting the container
----------------------

To pull the container from github container registry and run::

    $ docker run ghcr.io/DiamondLightSource/lunchbox:main --version
