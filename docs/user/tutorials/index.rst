Diffraction Experiment
======================

This tutorial takes you through step-by-step how to setup the hardware and
software components of this lunchbox beamline to run a diffraction experiment.
By the end of it, you will be able to see a plotted diagram of the results
of your scan, showing you how the distances between diffraction spots change
with increasing angle.

To follow along, make sure to read the how-to/follow-tutorial page if you are
unsure about how git works. We will walk through several git commits
representing different stages of development of the project.
