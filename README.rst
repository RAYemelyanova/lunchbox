lunchbox beamline
=================

|license|

A lunchbox beamline is an accessible and affordable tool to learn how the software
stack at Diamond works, using no more equipment than could fit inside a lunchbox. This
repository contains all the code necessary to setup and run a simple diffraction 
experiment, including some live processing for spot finding.

See the user guide for more instructions on how to set up the lunchbox beamline, run
the experiment, and walk through the tutorial of configuring it from the bottom up.

TODO: make a command line tool which will run the experiment for anyone wanting to just
get it working and use a python/ipython REPL...

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here::

    $ python -m lunchbox --version
